**Android Applications**

We are happy to announce the Open Source [Google Voice Locations Android App](http://code.google.com/p/android-google-voice-locations/) from Techventus, LLC.  It was built on this Google Voice Java Library. It uses the Enable/Disable functionality of Google Voice Java to allow location aware phone activation preferences to be set on Android.

[Steelgirder Development](http://sites.google.com/site/steelgirderdevelopmentsite/home/) has a wonderful plugin for Locale which incorporates the latest Google Voice Java API updates such as custom greeting, enable/disable, do not disturb, group settings, etc.
